# Sensor Reader
> Data read from different Sensors.
> 
> For 4 sensors we have 4 card views.
> 
> The latest value is shown on the card view.
> 
> Database use SQLite.
> 
> Datastore with time and value.
> 
> When a specific sensor card is clicked it filters data and views it in RV for that specific sensor.
> 
> Users can get notified at different times.
> 
> The app can run in the background.
> 
> Good UI and User Friendly Design.

# Challenge faced:
> The User gets notified in a specific period and data will be stored in the database in a specifically defined time.
